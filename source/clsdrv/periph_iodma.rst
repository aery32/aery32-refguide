Peripheral Input/Output DMA, `#include <aery32/periph_iodma.h> <https://github.com/aery32/aery32/blob/master/aery32/aery32/periph_iodma.h>`_
===========================

Direct memory access (DMA) allows peripheral hardware to access MCU's memory
independently of the central processing unit (CPU). This feature is useful
when the CPU cannot keep up with the rate of data transfer, or where the CPU
needs to perform useful work while waiting for a relatively slow I/O data
transfer. (`Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access>`_ 2013)
