Class drivers
-------------

.. note::

   You most likely want to use these, when ever possible.

Aery32 class drivers, abbreviated as *clsdrv*, are high level C++ classes.
Thus the name class driver. Class drivers commonly use low level module
functions to provide even more convenient and feature richer peripheral APIs.
